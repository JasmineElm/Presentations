# Generic Assignment Template

This repo contains my tools to make writing an academic document a little easier.


## Writing

+ Write the report in [the code directory](code/)
  + Single or multiple `*.md` files can be used.
+ Add references to [references.bib](code/references.bib)
+ Add images used in the report to [figures](code/figures)


## Rendering

```bash 
Simplifies building pdf / word documents 

Usage:
  build [cpwh]

Options:
  -h    Show this screen.
  -c    clear the output directory
  -p    build pdf
  -w    build word
```


## Suggested 3rd party apps

+ Zotero
+ Cookiecutter

_Note:_ You may want to drop this rep into a [cookiecutter](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) project, replacing the blank ```reports``` directory.
